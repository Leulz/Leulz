Oi! I am currently a Software Engineer at Rei do Pitaco, a fantasy game startup company in Brazil. I mainly focus on backend and infrastructure tasks, which are my favorite areas.

I have also worked for about 1.5 years at Nubank, a digital bank with tens of millions of customers. In it, I mainly worked with Observability (Prometheus, Thanos, SLIs/SLOs) and Infrastructure Provisioning (Kubernetes + AWS). 

Along with computer-related hobbies like programming, I also really love Philosophy and Japan. Eclectic, I know.
