Oi! I am currently a Software Engineer at Nubank. In it, I have been working a lot on infrastructure-related tasks, and have learned
many things, from monitoring concepts to Kubernetes clusters management.

Along with computer-related hobbies like programming, I also really love Philosophy and Japan. Eclectic, I know.
